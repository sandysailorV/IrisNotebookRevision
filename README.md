# Iris Classification
This project explores the well-known Iris dataset using six classification models. The goal is to evaluate which model best classifies images of the three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

Given that it’s been studied, I referenced a pre-coded notebook focused on understanding the workflow, running the models, and interpreting the results.

## View the Google Colab Notebooks into your Google Drive 
### Method 1: Create a Copy after having viewing access to the two notebooks 
Step 1: View the Google Colab Notebook. **Go to File → Save a copy in Drive**

Step 2: Close the original tab of viewable access notebook. 
Go to Google Drive  → Colab Notebooks → Find the copy of the notebook
Using this copy, you should be able to have your own edit access. 

### Method 2: Upload Notebook into Google Colab
Step 1: Download the .ipynb notebook 
Go to File → Download → Download .ipynb

Step 2: Upload .iynb notebook into an existing notebook
Go to an existing notebook → Upload Notebook 
From there, find the .ipynb notebook in your File Explorer

Step 3: Confirm Your Notebook is Loaded
Once your copy is done uploading, the notebook should automatically open

### Method 3: Open Notebook into a code editor 
Step 1: Download the .ipynb notebook 
Go to File → Download → Download .ipynb
