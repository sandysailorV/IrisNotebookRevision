# Iris Classification
This project explores the well-known Iris dataset using six classification models. The goal is to evaluate which model best classifies images of the three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

Given that it’s been studied, I referenced a pre-coded notebook focused on understanding the workflow, running the models, and interpreting the results.

## View the Google Colab Notebooks into your Google Drive 
### Method 1: Create a Copy after having viewing access to the two notebooks 
Step 1: View the Google Colab Notebook. 
  Go to File → Save a copy in Drive (see Figure 1)

Step 2: Close the original tab of viewable access notebook. 
Go to Google Drive  → Colab Notebooks → Find the copy of the notebook

Using this copy, you should be able to have your own edit access. 

### Method 2: Upload Notebook into Google Colab
Step 1: Download the .ipynb notebook 

Go to File → Download → Download .ipynb (see Figure 2)

Step 2: Upload .iynb notebook into an existing notebook
Go to an existing notebook → Upload Notebook (see Figure 3)
From there, find the .ipynb notebook in your File Explorer

Step 3: Confirm Your Notebook is Loaded
Once your copy is done uploading, the notebook should automatically open

## View the Google Colab Notebooks into a Code Editor Platform
### Option 1: Access Notebook using File Explorer options 
Step 1: Download the .ipynb notebook 
Go to File → Download → Download .ipynb 

Step 2: Find the notebook to open for the code-editor platform 
Option 1: Access Notebook through File Explorer
  1. Locate your notebook file in File Explorer
  2. Right-click the file and choose an option to open it with a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code). An example that you can do is open in Visual Studio Code/ VS Code (as shown in Figure 4)

### Option 2: Access Notebook on code-editors 
  1. Go to a code-editor python platform (e.g Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, or Spyder )
  2. Go to a File Tab 
  3. Select Open File to open your notebook manually (as shown in Figure 5)
