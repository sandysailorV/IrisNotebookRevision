# Iris Classification
This project explores the well-known Iris dataset using six classification models. The goal is to evaluate which model best classifies images of the three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

Given that itâ€™s been studied, I referenced a pre-coded notebook focused on understanding the workflow, running the models, and interpreting the results.
